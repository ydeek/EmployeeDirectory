# Employee Directory

## Description 

This React-based app demonstrates an employee directory that can be searched and sorted. The directory is filled via an API call to Random User Generator and includes photo, title, name,date of birth, e-mail and mobile phone number. Entering text into the search box will dynamically search all fields and filter those who match the entered text. The directory can be sorted by name. 


## User Story 
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context 

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
